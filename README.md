A variety of binaries for www pages. 

25.04.2024: I continue to explore the possibilities of generative models for generating a variety of graphics. This time I generated icon packs on different themes and in different styles. You can see both recognizable dragons or gnomes, and abstract Wi-Fi symbols or laser floppy disks with holes. You can contact me and I will make a personalized pak for you. Below is one of the examples, and there are some more in the ![pict](pict) folder.
